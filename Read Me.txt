This is an image classification Deep Learning network I’ve made. 
I’m using it to classify images into four classes: Cloud, Rain, Shine, and Sunrise.
This code takes in test images and uses them to build a neural network (samples provided).
The Personal Test Images are then classified and displayed just for fun! (called Cam images in Code)

If you’d like to run this code, don’t forget to
